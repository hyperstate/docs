                Media Types for Hypertext Sensor Markup
                       draft-koster-t2trg-hsml-00

Abstract

   The scale and scope of the worldwide web has been in part driven by
   the availability of HTML as a common serialization, data model, and
   interaction model for structured resources on the web.  By contrast,
   the general use of appropriate hypermedia techniques for machine
   interfaces has been limited by the lack of a common markup format for
   serialization and exchange of structured machine resources and
   sensor/actuator data which includes or embeds standardized hypermedia
   controls.  Machine optimized content formats exist for web links
   [RFC5988] [RFC6690] and for data items [I-D.ietf-core-senml].
   Structured data which contains both links and items is known as the
   collection type.  This draft describes media types for representation
   of machine resources structured as collections.  A common data model
   is described with a representation format that uses a common set of
   reserved keywords to expose hypermedia controls, which inform clients
   how to perform state transfer operations on resources.  The
   underlying assumptions regarding transfer layer processing are
   specified in this document.  The HSML media type described in this
   document is compatible both SenML and with CoRE Link-format by
   reusing the keyword identifiers and element structures from these
   documents in the base representation of the collection.

1.  Scope of this document

   This is a broadly scoped document which specifies representation
   formats, data models, interaction models, transfer mapping, URI
   processing, and some extensions including forms and bindings.

   The features listed above and new features may be specified and
   extended as needed in other documents which refer to this document.

2.  Overview and Use Case Requirements

   Use case requirements include the following.

   A standardized way to expose self-describing resource representations
   using embedded links and link annotations.

   A standardized way of organizing and interacting with resource
   instances using hyperlinks.

   A standardized encapsulation of resources for modeling things,
   capabilities, groups, indices, and other common structures.

3.  Data Model and Interaction Model

   The HSML data model consists of collections containing links and
   items.  An instance of a collection is identified by a URI.

   Items are data elements, either within the context the collection, or
   outide the context of the collection.  An instance of an item is
   identified by a URI.

   Links are standard web links as in [RFC5988] or [RFC6690].

   Items are identified by links in a collection.  An Item may only be
   in the context of one collection, but may be identified by any number
   of links in any number of collections.

   Links in a collection may point to items within the context of the
   collection or they may point to items external to the collection, on
   the same server or on other servers.

   Items in the collection that use the SenML data model may be embedded
   in the collection and transferred either along with the links or
   separately from links.

3.1.  Normative Representation

   JSON formatted examples are used in this document to illustrate
   normative and informative concepts.  Representations in other formats
   may be derived from the JSON representations.

3.2.  Links

   Links follow the specifications in [RFC5988] and [RFC6690] with
   extensions to implement forms and bindings as described in this
   document and any referencing extension documents.

Internet-Draft   Media Types for Hypertext Sensor Markup       June 2016


3.3.  Collections

   Collections contain one or more links and extended links, and may
   contain data items referred to by the links.  A representation of a
   collection may contain both links and data items.

3.4.  Link Embedding

   Link embedding emnables the transfer of more than one item in a
   collection using a single transfer operation.

3.4.1.  Batch operations on multiple items in a collection

   A collection of items enables operations on more than one item at a
   time by exposing a structured a representation of multiple resources
   in the collection.

   Applications may select resources by using URI parameters, and
   transfer representations of multiple resources using the SenML multi-
   item format.

3.4.2.  Collective operation on groups of linked resources

   Resource links in the collection may specify group transfer
   semantics, where transfer operations are replicated the resources
   indicated by the links optionally selected using URI parameters.
   Group responses are aggregated using the SenML multi-item format.

4.  Abstract Transfer Model

   The HSML media type assumes a transfer model capable of interacting
   with representations using a simple CRUD model, allowing for basic
   life cycle operations on resources and collections.

   CREATE
      Create an instance of a resource as specified using the payload as
      a constructor.  Optionally return a reference to the created
      resource.  Typically uses POST in CoAP or HTTP, may use PUBLISH in
      pubsub protocols.

   RETRIEVE
      Obtain a representation of the selected resource.  Typically uses
      GET in CoAP or HTTP, could use SUBSCRIBE with message retention in
      pubsub.

   UPDATE
      Replace or partially replace the representation of the selected
      resource.  Typically uses PUT or PATCH in CoAP and HTTP, could use

Internet-Draft   Media Types for Hypertext Sensor Markup       June 2016


      PUBLISH in pubsub in the frequent case that CREATE and UPDATE are
      not needed on the same resource.

   DELETE
      Remove the representation of the selected resource.  Typically
      uses DELETE in CoAP or HTTP.  There is no natural mapping to
      pubsub if a remove operation is not provided.

   OBSERVE
      Obtain a sequence of representations of the selected resource,
      indicating state updates which occur on the resource.  Typically
      uses CoAP Observe, HTTP EventSource, MQTT SUBSCRIBE.  OBSERVE is
      the transfer equivalent of performing a RETRIEVE on the resource
      immediately following each state change of the resource.

5.  Collections

5.1.  Base element

   A base element describe the context under which to interpret values
   in items within the representation of a colection.

   The base name element (bn) indicates the base URI or an absolute
   reference from which to base relative references found in the links.
   It functions as an embedded base URI reference as per [RFC3986]
   Section 5.1.1

   The format of the base elements are specified in
   [I-D.ietf-core-senml].  Figure 1 is an example of a base name
   element.

       "bn": "/dev/sen/temp/"

                     Figure 1: SenML Base Name Example

   Other base items from SenML are permissible, including base time (bt)
   and base value(bv).  If additional senml base element are present,
   the client MUST interpret the items in the collection in the context
   of the applicable base elements.  For example, if there is a "bv" or
   base value elment, all of the returned values from items in the
   collection MUST be added to the base value as per
   [I-D.ietf-core-senml].

5.2.  Link element

   A link element is a hyperlinks based on the structure and syntax of
   [RFC6690].  An example of link elements

Internet-Draft   Media Types for Hypertext Sensor Markup       June 2016


5.3.  Item element

   An item element in a collection is a data element that is referenced
   by a URI in the collection.  THe URI reference to an item in a
   collection must use the collection URI as context or specify a link
   anchor property to override the default context.

   Items may be embedded in the collection, they may be subresources of
   the collection, or they may be items in other collections referenced
   by links in the collection.

   Items in the collection must be indicated by a relative references
   (href) that serve as a selection variables for matching to URI
   parameters and resource names in multi-resource representataions.

6.  Representation Formats

   Example Serialization Formats {#example-formats} Figure 2 shows an
   example document in hsml+json format

   {
   }

                  Figure 2: application/hsml+json Example

7.  URI and Parameter Processing

   The HSML media type defines URI reference processing and URI Query
   processing but does not in general define fragment (#) references in
   URIs.

   If fragment references are provided in a particular transfer
   implementation, they should be used to select single items in
   collections in accordance with current practice.

7.1.  URI Path Processing

   The path part of the URI reference used to indicate HSML resources
   may be used as a reference to a collection or to an item in a
   collection.  Collection references should contain the trailing slash
   character "/" in accordance with BCP.  Server implementations should
   return links to collections with the trailing "/", and should attempt
   to accept references to collections without the trailing "/" if such
   references can be used to construct unambiguous references.

   References to items in a collection should not contain the trailing
   "/" character.  Servers should return item references that do not
   contain the trailing "/" character, and should should attempt to

Internet-Draft   Media Types for Hypertext Sensor Markup       June 2016


   accept references to items in collections with the trailing "/" if
   such references can be used to construct unambiguous references.

   URI references may be routed to collections in the order in which
   path segments appear in the reference, from left to right reading the
   path string, separated by "/" characters.

   URI references may alternatively be routed as opaque strings to
   resources.  In this case, the resolution of relative references to
   items in a collection should be possible by concatenating the
   relative reference to the context URI of the collection.  Note that
   this may enforce certain naming conventions such as the trailing
   slash in practice.

7.2.  URI Parameter processing

   URI Parameters, typically mapped as query parameters in HTTP and
   CoAP, are used for selecting resources, selecting partial
   representations, and otherwise modifying aspects of the expected or
   included representation.  In this way, they may be considered part of
   the URI, since they help identify a unique representation to be
   transferred.

7.2.1.  Resource selection

   URI Parameters may be used to select resources in a collection for
   transfer.  This is done using the common parameter matching rules
   specified in [RFC6690].

   Resource selection is performed based on matching URI Parameters with
   Link Parameters of all links in the collection which are exposed by
   the indicated media type and interface type.  URI Parameters listed
   in Section 10.2 are excluded from the matching process.

Internet-Draft   Media Types for Hypertext Sensor Markup       June 2016


8.4.  Groups

   Group transfer operations are provided by collections that contain
   links with the "grp" relation value.

   Transfer operations which specify the collection URI as target are
   sent to the resolved URI of each link in the collection that contains
   the "grp" relation.

   URI Parameters may be used to select a particular subset of target
   resources within the group in the collection.

   Responses from the selected group resources are aggregated and by
   default returned as a single response.  The group response SHOULD be
   returned as an outer array where such representation is available,
   for example a JSON array which contains elements consisting of SenML
   responses.

   Optionally, a chunked response may be specified, if allowed by the
   transfer implementation, in which the response from each group member
   is returned individually as a sequence of responses.

9.  Link extensions

9.1.  Forms

   Forms are hypermedia controls used to construct transfer operations
   that change the state of resources.  The vocabulary and semantics
   roughly follows the use of forms in HTML [RFC1866].

9.2.  Bindings

   Bindings are hypermedia controls used to construct transfer
   operations that expose state changes of resources.  A binding invokes
   an outbound transfer operation on a target resource.

10.  Reserved Identifiers

   This section defines the common reserved identifiers that are
   expected to be processed by implementations of HSML clients and
   servers.  There are many more relation types and link parameters
   defined and registered with IANA.  Implementations should not
   restrict processing to the keywords identified in this document; they
   should accept all IANA registered keywords as valid identifiers.

   Many of the keywords listed are defined in other RFCs and IETF
   documents.  This document does not redefine any existing keywords.
   Where a definition exists, the existing definition will be used.

Internet-Draft   Media Types for Hypertext Sensor Markup       June 2016


   Where multiple conflicting definitions exist, this document will
   indicate the required definition.

   New definitions are summarized in Section 11.

10.1.  Default CURIE

   Identifiers in representations using the HSML media types are assumed
   to use the default CURIE "hsml".  An identifier that is not matched
   to an existing namespace is assumed to carry the prefix "hsml".

   For example, if the identifier "method" is encountered and it doesn't
   resolve to an IANA registered parameter (reg-parameter in [RFC5988])
   resolution should be attempted using "hsml:method".

10.2.  URI Parameters

   The following URI Parameters are used to filter representations
   according to specific processing rules and should not be used to
   attempt to match link parameters.

   "if"  Interface type, used to select a partial representation of a
      collection

   "count"  Indicates the number of items to be returned from the
      collection

   "start"  Indicates the array index of the item in the collection to
      select as the first item to be returned

   "page"  Page number, in units of count

10.3.  Link Keywords

   The following keywords are reserved for use in an HSML serialization
   to indicate elements of a web link

   "anchor"
      overrides the default resource context of the link

   "rel"
      link relation type as defined in [RFC5988] and [RFC6690]

   "href"
      target of a link reference.  This may be a relative reference in
      the collection e.g. "currentValue" or a local absolute reference
      "/sensors/temp/currentValue" or a full reference
      "https://example.com/sensors/temp/currentValue"

   The following keywords are reserved for use in a HSML serialization
   to indicate types of link relations, and are used for values of
   "rel".

   "self"
      refers to the collection that contains the link

   "item"
      the link points to an item in the collection

   "sub"
      the link points to a subresource item of the collection

   "grp"
      the item the link points to is available for collective
      interaction through the collection URI according to group
      semantics described in {}

10.3.2.  Link Attribute Types

   The following keywords are reserved for use in a HSML serialization
   to indicate types of link attributes

   "rt"
      the resource type(s) of the item

   "u"
      units of measure

   "ct"
      the CoAP content-format number(s) associated with the item

   "content-type"
      the media type string(s) associated with the item

   "obs"
      presence of this attribute indicates that the associated resource
      is observable

10.4.  Item Keywords

   The following keywords are reserved for use in a HSML serialization
   to indicate elements within the serialization.  These are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-core-senml].

   "bn"

      the base name or base URI of the collection, relative to the
      service location e.g. "/sensors/temp/"

   "bt"
      the base time that corresponds to the encapsulated state of the
      collection

   "t"
      the time stamp that corresponds to the encapsulated state of the
      item in the collection, relative to the base time "bt"

   "n"
      the name or URI of the resource, relative to the base name of the
      collection e.g. "currentValue".

   "u"
      units of measure

   "v"
      number value

   "vb"
      boolean value

   "vd"
      data value, an extension to the senml value types to enable
      embedded data objects

   "vs"
      string value

10.5.  Link Parameters used in Forms

   "anchor"
      May override the default context of a form and store it in a
      different location from the subject resource

   "rel"
      Indicates the action being exposed by the form

   "action"
      URI for mapping an action specified in a form, similar to "href"
      in links

   "type"
      Additional indicator of the action being exposed, can be used with
      "rel"

   "method"
      Transfer method to use on a particular action

   "accepts"
      The Content-Types that are accepted on create and update methods

   "content-type"
      The Content-Types that are exposed by retrieve and observe methods

   "ct"
      the CoAP content-format number(s) exposed or accepted

   "schema"
      Indicates the schema to use for constructing or interpreting
      transfer payloads, may be a literal value or a URI pointing to an
      instance of a schema

10.6.  Link Parameters used in Bindings

   "id"
      The relative URI of this binding in its containing collection

   "anchor"
      May override the context URI of a binding with any observable
      resource

   "rel"
      Link relation indicates that this is a binding using the value
      "boundto"

   "target"
      The URI to bind to the context URI, where transfer operations will
      be sent, similar to "href" in links

   "method"
      Transfer method to use for notifications

   "content-type"
      The Content-Type to use in the transfer operation

   "ct"
      the CoAP content-format number to use in the transfer operation

   "schema"
      Schema to use in constructing the notification transfer payload

   "pmin"
      Minimum time between notification from a binding

Internet-Draft   Media Types for Hypertext Sensor Markup       June 2016


   "pmax"
      Maximum time between notifications from a binding

   "gt"
      value to match or exceed to determine notification condition

   "lt"
      value to match or be less than to determine notification condition

   "st"
      value change +/- from last report to determine notification
      condition

   "eq"
      value to match, or change from, to determine notification
      condition

   "nbll"
      Defines a lower limit, at or above which notification is enabled

   "nbul"
      Defines an upper limit, at or below which notification is enabled

   "init"
      Starts the notification state machine with an initial value

11.  IANA Considerations

11.1.  New Media Types for IANA Media Type registry

   type - hsml subtypes - collection - link - item

   application/hsml application/hsml.collection application/hsml.link
   application/hsml.item

   application/hsml+json application/hsml.collection+json application/
   hsml.link+json application/hsml.item+json

11.2.  New Content Formats for the IANA CoRE Parameters Registry

   (subject to Structured Syntax encoding rules TBD) 22000 -
   application/hsml+json 22001 - application/hsml.link+json 22002 -
   application/hsml.item+json

11.3.  New Link Parameters

   method schema content-type ct

   (the following should be registered in the CoRE Interfaces spin-off
   draft on asynchronous notification)

   pmin pmax nbll nbul init lt gt st eq

11.4.  New Link Relation Types (rel=)

   sub grp

   (the following should be registered in the CoRE Interfaces spin-off
   draft on asynchronous notification)

   boundto

11.5.  New Interface types (if=) for the IANA CoRE Parameters Registry

   hsml.collection hsml.item hsml.link

12.  Security Considerations

12.1.  Object Signing

   Collection representations are resource state encapsulations and may
   be transmitted and stored as signed objects in order to protect the
   integrity of data and metadata, including time and embedded access
   control information.

12.2.  Signed Embedded Time Stamps

   The collection may include time stamps (bt and t) that are signed
   with the object data and metadata.

12.3.  Signed Embedded Access Control

   The collection representation may include embedded access control
   information, also signed with the metadata, that can instruct the
   server to enforce a particular access policy for transfer requests.

12.4.  Secure State Updates

   Representations submitted to a server to update the state of a
   resource (UPDATE, CREATE, DELETE) may also contain embedded signed
   assertions which may be used by the server to decide whether to apply
   or reject the update.

12.5.  Object Signing and Encryption

   Object signing and encryption SHOULD use the mechanisms specified in
   IETF documents for secure JSON Objects [RFC7516] and CBOR Objects
   [I-D.ietf-cose-msg].

13.  Design Patterns

13.1.  RESTful Actuation using collections

13.2.  RESTful Events and Alerts using collections
